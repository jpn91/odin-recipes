    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ribeye Steak</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Thyme</li>
        <li>Garlic Clove</li>
    </ul>
   
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the ribeye steak and cover it in coarse salt.  Make sure you
            get all the edges.  Place the steak on a cooling rack on a tray and put it
            in the fridge.  Leave the steak in the fridge for at least 3 hours.  The longer 
            you leave the steak in the fridge, the beefier it will taste.  This is a process
            called dry-brining
        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven for 225 Degrees farenheit.</li>
        <li>Season the steak with the garlic powder and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place the steak in the oven. Depending on desired doneness,
            cook the steak in the oven anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>When the steak is almost done cooking in the oven, begin heating
            a cast-iron pan on the stove.  
        </li>
        <li>When the steak is done cooking in the oven, place the steak in the cast iron pan</li>
        <li>Add the butter, garlic, and thyme to the pan with the steak</li>
        <li>Baste the steak and flip it as often as needed to make sure it is cooked evenly and has developed a good crust</li>
        <li>After about 2 minutes of flipping and basting, remove the steak to a cutting board and allow it to rest for 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Open a bottle of red wine and pour a glass! Time to eat!</li>
    </ol>
